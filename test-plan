TEST PLAN:

I) SETTING INITIAL EEPROM VALUES
	1) first, press LEFT to go into STORY mode
	2) press LEFT again to see ranking and use UP and DOWN to scroll between different "results"
	3) notice what the "results" are like (depending on what is saved in your Arduino's EEPROM they may be more
	or less meaningful)
	4) press RESET to go back to menu
	5) press button UP to change EEPROM settings
	6) follow instructions displayed on Arduino until you get back to menu
	7) repeat steps I.1 to I.3 (this time all three results should be "XXX: 0")
	8) repeat step I.4
	
II) PRACTICE MODE TEST 
	1) press RIGHT to get into practice mode
	II.a) default settings test
		1) press SELECT to begin 
		2) observe the screen and memorise the sequence
		Displayed sequence should consist of 3 arrows from the set {LEFT, UP}
		3) enter the sequence correctly
		(If you enter the sequence correctly you get a choice to move on to the sequence of length N = 4 or change settings.)
		4) press RIGHT to continue game 
		5) enter incorrect sequence to get an error message
		6) choose to "play again" (button RIGHT)
		7) do not enter anything until you get an error message
		8) press LEFT to go back to menu
		9) repeat step II.1
		10) press RIGHT again to go to settings changing
		11) set values of M, N, T, D to your liking (however, unless you want to test yourself, when testing for long sequences, 
		I would change D to a really low value and would not try to memorise the sequence)
		12) repeat steps II.a.8 to II.a.11 a few times for different values
		13) when you are ready to move to next stage of testing, press LEFT to go back to menu
	
III) STORY MODE TEST
	1) open Serial monitor (it will be used later)
	2) press LEFT when in menu
	III.a) ranking display
	1) press LEFT to see ranking
	2) use UP and DOWN to scroll between results
	3) use RIGHT to go back to story menu
	III.b) story mode game 
	1) press RIGHT to go to level choice
	2) choose a level and observe screen to check if sequence is implemented correctly 
	(use "level specification" provided in Instructions)
	3) do not enter any answer and observe if you are automatically taken to menu
	III.c) saving your result in ranking
	(To be able to save your result in ranking you need to beat the lowest result in current ranking.)
	1) repeat steps III.1, III.2, III.b.1 (in this order) and choose EASY mode (press LEFT)
	2) observe screen and memorise the sequence
	3) repeat the sequence correctly
	4) when backlight is set to teal, press RIGHT to save your initials 
	5) follow instructions displayed on Arduino
	6) enter 3 initials, press ENTER and RESET your Arduino
	7) repeat steps III.2, III.a.1, III.a.2 (in this order) and see if your initials were saved
